# Architecture

TIAF is intended to occupy an intelligence boundary between sources of market
candidates and the system that governs risk and execution:

```text
Scanners / Manual input / Third-party sources
                    |
                    v
       TradingIntelligence / TIAF
                    |
                    v
        structured intelligence
                    |
                    v
              TradeMonitor
                    |
                    v
                 Broker
```

TIAF will produce timestamped, attributable, and evaluable structured
intelligence. It will not own broker execution authority. TradeMonitor remains
the governor, while the broker remains the final truth for live state.

## Long-term missions

### Opportunity Intelligence

Given a bounded universe plus a requested style and horizon, identify the
strongest forward underlying opportunities, preserve `WAIT`, `NO_TRADE`,
`ABSTAIN`, and insufficient-evidence outcomes, and estimate remaining
opportunity only when evidence supports it. A3 produces specialist underlying
intelligence; A6 separately owns `CE`/`PE` and option-expression selection.

### Position Intelligence

Evaluate existing or adopted positions prospectively. The service should
eventually support conclusions such as `HOLD`, `WATCH_CLOSELY`, `PROTECT`,
`PARTIAL_BOOK`, `BOOK`, or `EXIT` without requiring the original trade thesis.

## Package boundaries

The namespaces reserve clear seams for contracts, data, planning, specialist
interpretation, arbitration, workflows, memory, evaluation, service delivery,
and observability. TIAF_A1 implements the factual data boundary through
immutable `AnalysisContext`. TIAF_A2 adds deterministic features, indicators,
explicit-benchmark and multi-timeframe evidence, a transparent baseline, and
provider-free replay/evaluation. The provider-neutral A3 architecture is now
defined in [`TIAF_A3_ARCHITECTURE.md`](TIAF_A3_ARCHITECTURE.md), with sequential
implementation gates in
[`TIAF_A3_DETAILED_ROADMAP.md`](TIAF_A3_DETAILED_ROADMAP.md). Planning and
interpretive namespaces contain the accepted A3.1 provider-neutral contracts,
registry, and exactly-one-specialist runtime foundation. A3.2 adds controlled
evidence and optional reasoning gateways, least-privilege capability policy,
model/tool budgets, freshness-aware evidence reuse, no-LLM mode, and audit
records. A3.3 adds the first deterministic Technical / Market-Structure
specialist over immutable scalar A2 fact projections, with typed detail, cited
claims, explicit contradiction, and zero model usage. No live model adapter,
multi-Agent orchestration, or execution behavior is implemented.

## A3 architecture boundary

A3 Agents consume immutable A2 evidence through controlled, least-privilege
gateways; they do not recalculate A2 facts or receive arbitrary browser, shell,
database, broker, or execution access. An instrument-aware Planner selects
bounded specialists and reasoning depth under explicit token, tool, latency,
specialist, and cost budgets. A3 preserves individual cited opinions and
disagreement. A4 later arbitrates them, A5 manages adopted positions, A6 chooses
option expression, A7 evaluates and calibrates intelligence, and A8 integrates
with TradeMonitor without transferring authority.
