# TradingIntelligence

TradingIntelligence is the repository for **TIAF — Trading Intelligence Agent
Fabric**, a planned reusable market-intelligence service. Its long-term role is
to turn scanner, watchlist, manual, and third-party inputs into structured,
attributable intelligence for consumers such as TradeMonitor.

## Current stage

The **TIAF_TGT0** project-bootstrap baseline is complete and frozen. Development
is now at **TIAF_A0**, which adds versioned, validated domain contracts while
preserving all system authority boundaries.

It is **not** a trading system at this stage. It has no trading logic, agents,
workflows, scanners, broker integration, LLM calls, execution capability, or
TradeMonitor integration. Nothing in this repository currently produces or
acts on market recommendations.

## Layout

- `src/tiaf/` — application package and future capability namespaces
- `tests/` — unit, integration, and replay test suites
- `docs/` — architecture, principles, thesis, and milestone plan
- `examples/` — future usage examples
- `scripts/` — future development and operational helpers

## Installation

Python 3.12 or newer is required. From a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

For runtime dependencies only, use `python -m pip install -e .`.

## Verification

```bash
python -m compileall src
pytest
ruff check src tests
mypy src tests
```

## Milestone philosophy

Capabilities are introduced only when their contracts, boundaries, and tests
are ready. Each milestone should produce a small, independently verifiable
increment. Deterministic computation stays deterministic; judgment-oriented AI
capabilities will be introduced deliberately and remain subordinate to the
centralized authority and risk controls of TradeMonitor.

See [the implementation roadmap](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) for the
planned sequence.
